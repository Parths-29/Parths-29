## 👋 Hi, I'm Parth

I’m a 3rd-year IT student at **KJSCE** with a strong foundation in **Web Development**.  
Right now, I'm expanding my skill set into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain** because I’m interested in building systems that are smarter and more secure.

I believe in **learning by building**. My repositories are a mix of academic experiments, hackathon projects, and full-stack applications built to solve real-world problems.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- **Web Development:** Comfortable with the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and building responsive frontends.
- **AI & ML:** Exploring Computer Vision and LLMs, integrating models into web apps (e.g., *Neural Med-Assist*).
- **Blockchain:** Learning **Solidity** and Smart Contracts to understand decentralized systems.
- **Languages:** Native English/Hindi speaker, currently learning **German (Deutsch)** 🇩🇪 for future Master’s plans.
